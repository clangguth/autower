# What is this?

This is the source code of autower.

## And what on earth is autower?

autower is a plugin for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 (FS9)
which automatically sets the tower location to the closest airport.

The "official" homepage for autower is [here](https://christoph.rosenkeller.org/fs/autower).

And here is the more extensive [README.txt](README.txt)

### What gives?

This project contains all the source code for autower (starting with version 2.0.0).

It consolidates multiple source code releases into one neat git history, with tagged versions.

Compared to the original source code, I only added the `CMakeLists.txt` and the `.idea` folder to make the project compile in IntelliJ CLion (2019.1.3).


#### Final words?
By now, this repository is probably only useful for educational or historical purposes.
